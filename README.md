# Database Performance Testing

For the final project (outlined in file "final_project_report.pdf"), my parnter and I learned to improve the write performance of a Postgres database system through batch inserts, system variable tuning, and hardware resources (CPUs, RAM, Network).

Overall, this repo encompasses all I have acchomplished while attending a database course at UT. Throughout the course I had the pleasure of working with a variety of database technologies and data science tools: MySQL, Postgres, BigQuery, Firestore, MongoDB, Neo4j, Jupyter Notebooks, and Data Studio. First we start with the basic CRUD operations and moved on to more advanced capabilities. I liked working with PostgreSQL and decided to conduct further tests for the courses final project. 

### Contraints

There are better ways to improve database performance. But, I'm still learning and will dive deeper into database technologies at a future time.

### Getting Started

To extract the most value from this project, I  recommend taking a look at the queries and code in general and apply some of the techniques used in this repo to questions encountered on sites like  Sololearn.com, Codewars, HackerRank, or LeetCode. After that, start working on datasets that you are interested in. There are plenty of other resources available online to gain experience with any of the technologies this repo showcases.
